## Ontology Based Data Specifications

Labs collect, encode and store information in different ways. They use different fields, terms and formats, they categorize variables in different ways, and the meanings of words change depending on the focus of the organization. This variability makes comparing, integrating and analyzing data generated by different organizations like trying to compare apples, oranges and bananas, which is difficult to do. Ontologies are collections of controlled vocabulary that are arranged in a hierarchy, where all the terms are linked using logical relationships. Ontologies are open source and meant to represent “universal truth” as much as possible (so not tied to one organization’s vocabulary of use case). Using ontology terms to standardize contextual data not only helps make data more interoperable by using a common language, it also helps to make contextual data [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

## The PHA4GE Genotyping Contextual Data Specification Package

This specification supports implementation via spreadsheet-based data collection instruments, with accompanying **Field** and **Term reference guides**.New terms and/or term changes can be requested using issue request forms, with additional guidance on how to do so outline in the New Term Request (NTR) SOP. This resources are available in the files of this repository and listed below under **Package Contents**.

### Version Control

Please note that development of the specification is dynamic and it will be updated periodically to address user needs. Versioning is done in the format of `x.y.z`.

`x` = Field level changes <br>
`y` = Term value / ID level changes <br>
`z` = Definition, guidance, example, formatting, or other uncategorized changes

Descriptions of changes are provided in [release notes](https://github.com/cidgoh/PHA4GE_genotyping_specification/releases) for every new version.
